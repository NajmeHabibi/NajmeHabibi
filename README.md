### Hi, I'm Najme! ðŸ‘‹

I graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering. For about the last two years, I have been studying and implementing Machine Learning models. In this journey, I started as an NLP intern at Wise Intelligent Agent company and then moved into an Machine Learning Engineer (NLP) role at [PART](https://www.linkedin.com/company/partdp-ai/) company!
