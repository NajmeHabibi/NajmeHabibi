### Hi, I'm Najme! ðŸ‘‹

For about the last two years, I have been studying and implementing Machine Learning models. In this journey, I started as an NLP intern at Wise Intelligent Agent company and then moved into an NLP researcher role at PART company. Before I become a fan of machine learning, I was a computer engineer student. Being encountered lots of software development projects in university, I decided that something between ML and Software development is my best fit. Therefore, Iâ€™m seeking an ML Engineer job right now.
